Solano County's diverse landscape encompasses urban centers, agricultural land, and protected open spaces. Understanding current land use patterns through data analysis reveals important trends for future planning decisions.

## Current Land Use Distribution

Based on county assessor data and general plan designations:

- **Agricultural**: ~65% of total county land area
- **Residential**: ~15% (varying density from rural to urban)
- **Commercial/Industrial**: ~8%
- **Open Space/Recreation**: ~7%
- **Public/Institutional**: ~5%

## Urban Growth Patterns

Data from the past decade shows:
- Most new residential development concentrated in existing urban areas
- Limited conversion of agricultural land to urban uses
- Increasing density in transit-accessible locations

## The Housing-Jobs Balance

Analysis reveals spatial mismatches between where people live and work:
- Many residents commute outside the county for employment
- Job centers don't always align with affordable housing locations
- Transportation infrastructure impacts both housing and employment choices

## Agricultural Land Preservation

Solano County's agricultural economy depends on maintaining productive farmland:
- Williamson Act contracts protect significant acreage
- Development pressure varies by location and market conditions
- Climate change impacts add complexity to land use planning

## Data Gaps and Opportunities

Current land use analysis would benefit from:
- More frequent updates to land use classification data
- Better integration of environmental and economic factors
- Enhanced public access to planning and zoning information

Understanding these patterns helps inform discussions about growth management, housing policy, and agricultural preservation as the county plans for future development.
