OpenSolano is a way to bring people together to work on
shared issues that matter to them.
In many cases, the issues are civic in nature;
parks, education, public safety, public services, public accountability.

OpenSolano runs this website and holds meetups to get people together to
discuss local civics and play with technology to shed some light on some of the issues.
