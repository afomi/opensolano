What can we do to improve public meetings?

The decorum and formalized process in a council chambers can
be understood and worked with and within, productively.

The Solano County Board of Supervisors records their videos
and makes them available.

## What if we:

* made the transcripts searchable
* identified people in the video, talking
* annotated public meeting videos with captions, statistics, and commentary
* linked additional context based on past meetings and other public documents (example: link budget documents or project plans across different points on a timeline)
