How accessible are municipal budgets across Solano County's seven cities? A recent review reveals significant variation in how local governments present their financial information to the public.

## The Transparency Spectrum

Solano County cities fall along a spectrum of budget transparency:

**Most Accessible**: Cities that provide searchable, downloadable budget data with clear explanations of major expenditure categories and revenue sources.

**Moderately Accessible**: Cities that publish PDF budget documents with some supplementary materials but limited interactive features.

**Least Accessible**: Cities where budget information requires multiple clicks through various pages or lacks current-year details.

## Key Findings

- Only 3 out of 7 cities provide budget data in machine-readable formats
- Public engagement opportunities vary widely during budget adoption processes  
- Capital improvement project tracking differs significantly between jurisdictions

## The Civic Impact

Better budget transparency enables:
- More informed public participation in budget hearings
- Easier comparison of spending priorities across cities
- Enhanced accountability for financial stewardship
- Improved data-driven advocacy by community groups

## Recommendations

Cities could enhance budget transparency by:
1. Publishing budget data in standardized, downloadable formats
2. Creating budget summaries written for general audiences
3. Providing multi-year trend analysis
4. Implementing public feedback systems for budget priorities

*Analysis based on public budget documents available as of June 2024. Individual cities may have made improvements since this review.*
