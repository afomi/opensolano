This reporter’s brief outlines what Measure T is, why it’s up for renewal, the fiscal impacts, accountability mechanisms, and story angles you can localize for your audience. Copy, adapt, and cite original sources linked below.

## The Basics

- What it is: A local transactions and use tax (sales tax) that funds transportation investments countywide (roads, transit, safety, bike/ped improvements).
- Rate: Typically 0.25% to 0.5% stacked on top of the state base. Confirm current rate and renewal proposal text for exact figures.
- Term: Most renewals propose 20–30 years to support bonding and long-horizon capital plans.
- Admin: Usually administered via the countywide transportation authority (e.g., Solano Transportation Authority, STA) with expenditure plans adopted by ordinance.
- Voter threshold: Transportation special tax renewals often require two-thirds (66.7%) voter approval if revenues are legally earmarked; confirm with county counsel/elections.

## What’s Changing In The Renewal

Ask and report on differences between the existing and proposed measure:

- Rate and term: Any change to the rate or years (e.g., extend 30 years vs. sunset in 203X)?
- Project list: New corridor projects, interchanges, safety hotspots, transit frequency, paratransit, safe routes to school, maintenance backlog.
- Revenue sharing: City/County formula changes; “local streets and roads” flexible share vs. set-asides.
- Equity and safety: Dedicated funding for underserved neighborhoods, crash reduction targets, ADA curb ramps, heat/flood resilience.
- Climate alignment: Transit/bike/ped priorities, VMT reduction strategies, zero-emission bus deployment, coordination with CAPs and RTP/SCS.

## Money: How Much, From Where, For What

- Revenue forecast: $X per year, $Y over the measure term (state your assumed growth and elasticity; cite source memo/table).
- Sources: Local add-on sales tax on taxable retail; sensitivity to recessions and retail mix shifts (auto sales, e‑commerce allocation rules).
- Uses: Break down by program buckets (percentages) and example projects. Show what portion is “pay‑as‑you‑go” vs. leveraged for grants/bonds.
- Leverage: How local $1 unlocks $3–$6 in state/federal funds (illustrate with recent ATP, SB1, RAISE, MEGA awards if applicable).

### Quick math you can localize

- Household impact: Multiply local median taxable retail spend by the add-on rate. Note that essentials (most groceries, rent, services) are not taxed.
- City-by-city share: If there’s a population/road-mile formula, estimate annual allocations for each city and unincorporated area.
- Backlog framing: Compare expected local streets/roads allocations to pavement management needs (PCI targets) to illustrate the gap.

## Accountability & Oversight

- Independent Citizens’ Oversight Committee: Membership, meeting cadence, annual reports, Brown Act compliance, vacancies.
- Annual audits: Financial + compliance audits published on the authority’s website; include links.
- Performance measures: Safety (KSI reductions), state of good repair, on-time delivery, cost containment, climate/air metrics.
- Project controls: Programming policies, change-order thresholds, risk management, right-of-way readiness standards.
- Transparency: Public project dashboard, spend-to-date, schedule status, map of funded locations.

## Timeline & Ballot Mechanics

- Key dates: Board action to place on ballot, ballot argument deadlines, voter guide publication, vote date, effective/sunset dates.
- Ballot label/summary: 75-word limit highlights; verify claims about “no increase” or “independent oversight”.
- Legal standards: Two-thirds vs. simple majority—depends on whether revenues are earmarked (special tax) or general and whether council/initiative.

## Comparisons & Context

- Peer counties: How Solano’s rate and program mix compare to Napa, Yolo, Contra Costa, Sonoma, Alameda.
- Past performance: Delivery of prior Measure T commitments; notable overruns or under-budget deliverables.
- Grant competitiveness: Whether a local match strengthens applications (ATP, SB1 Solutions for Congested Corridors, FTA/FTA CIG).

## Story Angles You Can Localize

- Safety first: Map deadly and severe-injury crash corridors; match to proposed safety investments.
- Commute reality: Transit frequency gaps and travel-time reliability fixes for top commute flows.
- Equity lens: Which neighborhoods see capital and maintenance dollars—pair with CalEnviroScreen/low-income tracts.
- Main Street maintenance: Pavement and ADA upgrades in city centers; before/after PCI targets.
- Schools: Safe Routes to School projects near campuses; student arrival/dismissal safety.
- Procurement & jobs: Local hire, small business participation, DBE goals, apprenticeship pathways.

## Sourcing Checklist (drop these links into your piece)

- Ordinance + Expenditure Plan (renewal draft)
- STA Board packets, staff reports, slide decks
- Independent Oversight Committee bylaws, rosters, annual reports
- Annual audited financial statements; single audit if applicable
- Pavement Management Program/PCI reports (MTC StreetSaver)
- Collision data: SWITRS summaries; county Vision Zero plans
- Environmental/air: CAP, regional SCS, MTC Plan Bay Area docs
- Election calendar: County Registrar of Voters deadlines

## Questions To Put To Officials

1. What percent of the program directly reduces severe injuries and fatalities within five years?
2. Which projects will start construction in the first 2–3 years versus later in the term?
3. How will the agency keep costs in check if bids come in high—scope cuts, phasing, or additional match?
4. What happens if revenues underperform—what’s the contingency policy?
5. How will progress be reported to the public—dashboard cadence, success metrics, and independent validation?

## Data Box (fill with local numbers before publishing)

- Proposed rate: 0.25% (example)
- Term: 30 years (2025–2054)

- Buckets (example): 35% Local Streets & Roads; 20% Safety; 20% Transit; 10% Active Transportation; 10% Congestion Relief; 5% Program/Admin
- Oversight: Independent citizens’ committee; annual audit; public dashboard

## Visuals You Can Reproduce

- Map: Top 10 high-injury corridors (last 5 years) with proposed countermeasures.
- Bar chart: Annual allocations by city vs. pavement needs (PCI target line).
- Timeline: Renewal milestones from board vote to first construction start.

## Boilerplate Language (Attribution‑Friendly)

“Measure T is a local transactions and use tax that funds transportation improvements throughout Solano County, including safety, transit, street maintenance, and bicycle/pedestrian projects. The renewal would extend the program for an additional term to continue investments and leverage state and federal matching funds. Revenues are subject to independent oversight and annual audits.”
