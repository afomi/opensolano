# Blog Post Guidelines for OpenSolano

## Using Tags Effectively

Tags are our primary way to organize content and help readers find related posts. Use them strategically to create clear content pathways around civic topics.

### Tag Categories

Use a mix of these tag types for each post:

#### 1. Civic Topic Tags (Broad Categories)
These high-level tags help readers browse by civic interest areas:
- `energy` - Renewable energy, utilities, energy efficiency
- `education` - Schools, community colleges, workforce development
- `healthcare` - Public health, hospitals, community wellness
- `transportation` - Transit, highways, bike infrastructure
- `housing` - Development, affordability, zoning
- `environment` - Sustainability, water, waste management
- `economic-development` - Business, jobs, tourism
- `public-safety` - Police, fire, emergency services
- `agriculture` - Farming, food security, preservation
- `infrastructure` - Water, roads, broadband, facilities
- `parks-recreation` - Public spaces, community programs
- `governance` - Government operations, transparency, civic engagement

#### 2. Specific Subject Tags
More granular tags for particular topics:
- `impact-fees` - Development impact fees
- `budgets` - Municipal finances
- `zoning` - Land use planning
- `meetings` - Public meetings, transparency
- `elections` - Voting, candidates, measures
- `data` - Open data, analysis methodology

#### 3. Geographic Tags
Location-specific content:
- `solano-county` - County-wide issues
- `benicia`, `dixon`, `fairfield`, `rio-vista`, `suisun-city`, `vacaville`, `vallejo` - City-specific content

#### 4. Content Type Tags
What kind of analysis or content:
- `analysis` - Data-driven research
- `explainer` - Educational content
- `news` - Current events commentary
- `tutorial` - How-to content

### Tagging Best Practices

1. **Use 3-6 tags per post** - Enough for discoverability, not so many that meaning is diluted

2. **Start broad, get specific** - Always include at least one civic topic tag, then add specific subject and geographic tags

3. **Be consistent** - Use the same tag format across posts (e.g., always `economic-development`, not `economic development` or `econ-dev`)

4. **Think like a reader** - What would someone search for to find this content?

5. **Create tag families** - Related posts should share key tags to create browsing pathways

### Example Tagging

**Post about Vacaville's housing development fees:**
- Tags: `housing`, `development`, `impact-fees`, `vacaville`, `analysis`

**Post explaining how to read a city budget:**
- Tags: `governance`, `budgets`, `transparency`, `explainer`

**Analysis of county transportation planning:**
- Tags: `transportation`, `infrastructure`, `solano-county`, `analysis`

### Tag Strategy Goals

- **Topic Discovery**: Readers can find all content about energy, housing, etc.
- **Geographic Focus**: Easy to find content about specific cities or county-wide issues
- **Content Depth**: Mix of broad civic topics with specific policy details
- **Reader Pathways**: Related posts naturally connect through shared tags

This approach gives us the organizational benefits of broader topic categories while maintaining the flexibility and specificity of a tag system.
